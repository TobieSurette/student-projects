# Toad crab analysis

# Background
There are two species of **toad crab** (also called spider crab) which inhabit the deep, colder waters in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence: the *Greater* and *Lesser* Toad Crabs. As the name implies one species grows to larger sizes than the other. The two species can be differentiated using exterior features: the Lesser Toad crab has longer claws than the Greater Toad Crab, and it has two projecting "ears" or "horns" on either side of its head.

Currently, there is a small fishery for Greater Toad Crab. Toad crab stocks are rarely assessed, so there is much uncertainty regarding their abundance, population dynmaics and  status.

## Project description

Toad crab in the southern Gulf are data-rich species for which little attention has been paid. There is a learning opportunity to analyze a fairly rich dataset and answer some basic questions regarding the stock in the southern Gulf.

## Data sources

For Toad crab in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, there are two major data sources : the **September mutlipecies survey** and the **snow crab trawl survey**. Both are bottom trawl surveys that are performed annually and have data on toad crab starting in the 1990s. These surveys cover the deeper waters of the southern Gulf (i.e. more than 20 meters depth), which covers most of the Toad Crab habitat.

Data quality and detail increases over the available time series for both of these surveys. Earlier data generally contain crab count and catch weight data at each sampled location. The two species of toad crab were somtetimes lumped together or misidentified. Data later in the series have the two species reliably separated. Body size-frequency samples are available for both species in the Septmeber multi-species survey, starting in 2003. Body size measurements on the snow crab survey are only available starting in 2023. The snow crab survey catches more Toad Crab and has double the spatial sampling density compared to the Septmeber multispecies Survey.

## Goals / research questions

Here are the possible goals, in order of difficulty:
- Explore crab density versus depth / water temperature. What is the general pattern for each species? Does this pattern evolve over time?
- What is the general spatial distribution for each species?
- What is the abundance or biomass for each species for key categories, e.g. commercial crab?
- Can we identify the main drivers which predict the presence of each species?
- With warming waters due to climate change, what are the likely changes in density and distribution that we could expect?
