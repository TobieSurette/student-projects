# Toad crab analysis

There are two species of tad crab in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence: the Greater and Lesser Toad Crabs. As the name implies one species grows to larger sizes than the other. There is a small fishery for Greater Toad Crab. Toad crab stocks are rarely assessed, so there is much uncertainty regarding their status and some aspects of their biology.

## Project description


## Data sources

For Toad crab, there are two major data sources : the September mutlipecies survey and the snow crab trawl survey. 

Both are bottom trawl surveys that are performed annually and have data on toad crab starting in the 1990s. 

These surveys cover the deeper waters of the southern Gulf (i.e. more than 20 meters depth), which covers most of the Toad Crab habitat. 

Data quality and detail increases over the available time series for both of these surveys.
