# Crab group identification & clustering methods

## Background
There are many biological processes which lead to distinct groups within snow crab populations. They often have measurable features which can be used to identify them in a mixed sample. 

**Table 1** : List of snow crab different snow crab groups that can be identified using field and laboratory data.

| Group                  | Description                                        | Identification
|------------------------| -----------------------------------------------    | ------------------------------------
| **Instar**             | Number of time crab has changed shells.            | Crab size-frequency analysis.
| **Maturity**           | immature, pubescent or mature.                     | External or internal characteristics.
| **Shell condition**    | Soft-shelled or hard-shelled.                      | Shell characteristics (e.g. colour).
| **Reproductive stage** | Primiparous or multiparous females                 | Shell condition and egg quantity.
| **Reproductive cycle** | 1-year or 2-year egg production cycle for females. | Reproductive stage and incubation year.
| **Incubation year**    | First or second year of egg incubation.            | Egg characteristics (e.g. colour, development stage).

## Strategy

Do a thorough **data exploration** to examine the relationships between the observed variables.

Using crab body size measurements, colorimetry data, and organ weight measurements, test different **discrimant analyses** (when the group is identified) or **clustering analyses** (when the group is unidentified).

Possible approaches include: developing and pplying univariate and multivariate clustering methods (e.g. mixture models, support vector machines). 

## Data

- Snow crab survey size data (30 years, about 1 million observations).
- Small sets of samples at a few locations through time with a suite of measurements, including: colorimetry of exterior shell and internal organs, size of interior organs, etc ...
