| Project               | Goal                                                                                                                           | Topic              | Keywords 
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
| **Crab clustering**   | Development of new identification methods for various snow crab group from observational data.                                 | Applied statistics | clustering, finite mixture models, regression analysis, optimization
| **Messy crab data**   | Development of new methods for characterizing and analyzing messy univariate crab measurement data from at-sea observer program. Identify and quantify a variety of issues and bad practices. 
                                                                                                                                                         | Applied mathematical statistics | multinomial models, error decomposition & bias correction, optimization
| **Size-at-maturity**  | Clarify the theory and concepts surrounding size-at-maturity in the biological literature. List out different defintions of size-at-maturity which are commonly used and discuss whether estimation methods are appropriate.                                                                                                                                                                              | Mathematical biology | maturation processes & measures, size-frequency analysis and simulation
| **Toad Crab**         | Analysis of Toad Crab data from the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence.                                                             | Mathematical biology | spatial analysis, abundance and biomass estimation, size-frequency analysis
